We have `sami.php` file too.

I only included the sami.phar file to my project as it was described in the installation part. So when I use
```
$ php sami.php
````
I get the following error message: Could not open input file: sami.php

I guess, when Sami installed globally via Composer or as vendor in a project, then sami.php works.

Yes I think so as well. But to follow the installation foot steps I suggest that you change the command to php sami.phar instead.

Maybe we should document both ways of running.

:-1: for this as is.

I think this change makes sense as the README starts by recommending the user to download the phar archive. So, the first of the README uses `sami.phar` and then we are using `sami.php`. So, this PR is really a bug fix for this inconsistency.
