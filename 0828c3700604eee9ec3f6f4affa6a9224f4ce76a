@fabpot , the code style check is reporting issues that existed in changed files, but not in the code changed in this PR. For example Scrutinizer CI remembers what issues exists in `master` and only reports changes in the PR branch.

I've rebased on master so now it can be merged from GitHub website.

I've fixed CS issues reported by status.fabpot.io. I've kept is a separate commit, because CS violations weren't introduced by my changes.

@fabpot , any opinion on this PR. Is it needed. If so, then what should I adjust for it to be merged?

Was anything like this PR ever integrated into Sami?

@fabpot , another ping. If you need anything fixed, then I can do that. Otherwise if nobody has any objections, then please merge.

This PR looks good to me.

I've squashed and rebased PR so now it can be merged.

The failure of `fabbot.io` is:

* not on the lines I've changed
* probably caused by standard change, that isn't now allowing aligning of array key/value pairs
