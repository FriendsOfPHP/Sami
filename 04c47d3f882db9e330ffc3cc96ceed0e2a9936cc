I'm not sure how PSR-1 is related to made changes, but you've indeed changed based class for test case class extension to support PHPUnit 6.

@aik099 Just mentioned PSR-1 because namespaces usually are `Foo\Bar\Class` that before `PHP 5.3` were `Foo_Bar_Class` :smile:

I've updated `phpunit-bridge` to version 4.0. This will help us test PHP 7.2 in #314
