Ok, I have reset the commit for netbeans. I've put it in the end of PR in that case. No problem.

By the way, this project is very cool, specially because it is very straitforward, unlike other doc generator (I'm contributing to phpDocumentor, it is a hell to debug)

Sorry I don't know this was a problem. Hope this helps :beers:
