What typo?

Do you see that `fabbot` build failed? If you click on it the detail report will show with all stuff that needs to be fixed. It even gives you patches that you can apply to fix it.

@aik099 That wasn't from my pull request. That is an existing typo. I'll make another pull request to deal with that...
